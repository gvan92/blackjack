# blackjack_OOP
blackjack (OOP Python)

This project encapsulates the basic concepts of object oriented programming in Python. Concepts include data types (dictionaries), classes and objects, attributes, properties, constructors, methods and inheritance.

The game is a simplified version of the Blackjack game. There are two files. The 'objects.py' file sets up the Card, Deck, and Hand classes. These will be critical for playing the Blackjack game.

The second file is 'blackjack.py' where the rules of the game are implemented. Note that not all aspects of the game, such as you would find at a casino, have been implemented. There are no options for insurance or to split or double down.
